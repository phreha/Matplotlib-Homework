# Unit 5 | Assignment - The Power of Plots
## Option 1: Pyber
* You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.

The average fares in rural areas are the highest.  This is due to a low amount of drivers in the area but also suggests the trips are longer, possibly to suburban/urban areas.

A couple cities in urban areas could benefit from adding more drivers as these cities see a high demand in rides but a low number of drivers.

The data makes sense that the average fare would be less in urban areas not only because there are more drivers in the urban areas, but also because they aren't traveling as far.  Most entertainment/nightlife is in the urban areas and people tend to ride share more often in these areas to avoid parking prices or possibly DUIs!
